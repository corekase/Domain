Pygame is the only required dependency.

This project aims to be a complete game of some kind in the end, mainly about showcasing systems that work well together.  It is not a library and is instead a reference implementation of the said systems.  Then, this code, for your project, is meant to be cannibalized to suit your specific needs.  As a reference, you are completely free to reimplement the systems in another language or project.  If you do so then the GPL-3.0 license doesn't apply to that code.

Controls:

left-click on map moves the avatar to that location.
mouse-wheel controls zooming.
while zoomed, holding right-mouse-button scrolls around the map.

There are three floors, pressing the number keys 1, 2, and 3 show them.

F1 toggles between absolute coordinates and coordinates relative to floor.

Winning:

The game is won by gathering the items you can pick up and putting them all down into the same square.

If you can pick up a item a button will appear when you are on the same square.  When you have an item there will be a put down button.

You may only have one item in your inventory at a time.
