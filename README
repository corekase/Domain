Pygame is the only required dependency.

This project aims to be a complete game of some kind in the end, mainly about showcasing systems that work well together.  It is not a library and is instead a reference implementation of the said systems.  Then, this code, for your project, is meant to be cannibalized to suit your specific needs.  As a reference, you are completely free to reimplement the systems in another language or project.  If you do so then the GPL-3.0 license doesn't apply to that code.  Reference implementation.
